            <article>Between the museums, outdoor markets, mountains of chocolate, and shopping,<br>
                <b>Geneva</b> is truly a hidden gem in Switzerland. Surrounded by the Alps, <br>
                the city is the definition of the “city of peace.” There are so many different things<br>
                to do in Geneva so it can be hard to decide just what to see, what to do,<br>
                and where to stay if you’ve never visited before, so I've compiled my ultimate guide<br>
                to Geneva here for your next trip to Switzerland!

            <h2>Zermatt, <br>unique view to<br> the Alps</h2>
            <img src="img/Zermatt.jpg" alt="Zermatt" width=30% class="second_post_img">
            <article>English explorer Edward Whymper brought this town to international attention<br>
                when he conquered the Matterhorn, Switzerland’s highest peak, in the mid-19th century.<br>
                <b>Zermatt</b> provides incomparable views of the Alps, and the river Matter Vispa trickling<br>
                through it only adds to the charm of this small town. There are a number of cable cars<br>
                and chair lifts for skiers, and for those who have a head for heights, the Gornergrat Bahn <br>
                – the highest open-air railway in Europe – runs to the summit of the Gornergrat.<br>
                Almost all the cars in the town are electric, making Zermatt very eco-friendly. Other culturally<br>
                significant attractions include the rock carvings and prehistoric grinding stone at Hubelwäng.
